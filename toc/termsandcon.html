          community of developers in the world, and invites you to participate in the community by sharing knowledge
          with your peers and colleagues. Like all communities, we ask that you participate in a manner that respects
          your fellow community members. To that end, we provide you with these terms of service to advise you of the
          legal obligations you assume when you engage with the Code Exchange community or otherwise access or use the
          public Network or any services provided on the public Network (collectively, “Services”). These terms govern
          the use of the public Network (the “Public Network Terms”).</p>

          limitation by registering for an account on behalf of a Company or Team, your use of those products (such as
          Code Exchange for Teams or Code Exchange Business) is governed by their relevant Terms and Conditions.</p>

              notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the public Network. You shall be responsible for reviewing and

              SECTION TITLED “MANDATORY ARBITRATION” BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE
              RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
              LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

            <h3>Contracts are Binding and Legally Enforcable – Please Read!</h3>
            <p>As stated above, these Public Network Terms constitute an agreement between Code Exchange and you and
              governs your use of the public Network. These Public Network Terms do NOT govern the use of our Talent,
              Enterprise and other Code Exchange products and services that are not part of the public Network. In the
              event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of these Public Network Terms and any such service

          <li class="content-cell" id="eligib">
            <h3>Age Eligibility</h3>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old to access or use the Network or Services, including without limitation
              to complete a Code Exchange account registration. By accessing or using the Services or the Network in
              any manner, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years
              old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, access or use the Services or Network in any
              manner, and may not provide any personal information to or on the Services or Network (including, for
              example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).</p>
            <p>If you are located within the European Union, you must be at least 16 years old to access or use the
              Network or Services, including without limitation to complete a Code Exchange Account Registration. By

              least 16 years of age. If you are under 16 years old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any
              reason, access or use the Services or Network in any manner, and may not provide any personal information

            <h3>Access to the Public Network</h3>
            <p>Any user of the public Network is welcome to participate in community discussions, to answer questions,
              and to share their hard earned knowledge with public Network community participants, provided that they
              comply with the obligations set forth in these Public Network Terms, and to the extent that use of the
              public Network does not conflict with the applicable laws, rules and regulations of the user’s
              jurisdiction. Code Exchange reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public
              Network if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have in any way violated these Public Network
              Terms or are otherwise ineligible to access or use the Network or Services. If your actions are determined
              by us to violate these Public Network Terms, Code Exchange may, in its sole discretion, try to remediate
              that violation by working with you individually, but is under no obligation to do so, and if any such
              remediation efforts are unsuccessful (in Code Exchange’s sole discretion), then Code Exchange may revoke
              your rights to the Network. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Public Network Terms are in
              compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, and the right to access the Network or
              any Services is revoked where these Public Network Terms or use of the Network or any Services is
              prohibited or conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
            <p>Code Exchange will use reasonable efforts to make the public Network available 24/7/365, but from
              time-to-time we will have scheduled outages for maintenance purposes and other upkeep. Where feasible, we
              may, in our sole discretion, make efforts to inform you about any outages and report on the nature and
              reason for any outages that may occur in an open and transparent manner, though we are under no obligation
              to do so, and in any case will not be liable for any downtime.</p>

            <h3>User Obligations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>To access some of the public Network features you will need to register for an account as an
                individual and consent to these Public Network Terms. If you do not consent to these Public Network
                Terms, Code Exchange reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public
                Network.</li>
              <li>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your account registration is complete and remains up to
                date. You have the right to discontinue use of, or terminate, your account whenever you like, and
                subject to our Privacy Policy, control the use and sharing of your account information. Please note that
                any content or information you share publicly is governed by the terms described below in the section
                titled “Content Permissions, Restrictions, and Creative Commons Licensing,” and you should be aware that
                once you place content in the public sphere, you willingly give up some rights and control over such
                content.</li>
              <li>Code Exchange strongly encourages you to review our Privacy Policy, which explains how we will
                handle, process, and use your personal data, and with whom, and how we will share this data.</li>
              <li>Code Exchange is a community and we expect you to treat each member of the Code Exchange community
                with respect. Whether a community member is asking their first question, or is a reputation superstar,
                we respect you and welcome you, but we also require you to be kind to one another. To prevent bad actors
                from creating a negative community experience, we have outlined what we believe to be common sense rules
                for community participation and reserve the right to pause or terminate your account if you engage in
                disruptive, abusive, or nefarious behavior outside of Code Exchange’s Acceptable Use Policy, which is
                hereby incorporated into these Public Network Terms.</li>

                connect to or access the Network or otherwise use the Services, including without limitation modems,
                hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service. You are solely responsible for
                ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services and Network.</li>

                (in whole or in part) without your consent to a corporate affiliate, or in connection with a merger,
                acquisition, corporate restructure or reorganization, or due to the sale of all or substantially all of
                our assets.</p>
              <p>These Public Network Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of
                the State of New York, without giving effect to the principles of that State regarding conflicts of
                laws. Both you and Code Exchange hereby irrevocably agree to the sole and exclusive personal
                jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York with respect to any action, suit, or proceeding
                brought by it or against it by the other party in connection with the Network or Services.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Public Network Terms shall not prevent either party from seeking
                injunctive relief with respect to a violation of the confidentiality provisions and indemnification
                provisions contained in these Public Network Terms. The Uniform Commercial Code shall not apply to the

              <li class="sub-heading"><i>Mandatory Arbitration</i></li>
              <p>YOU AGREE THAT WITH RESPECT TO ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Code Exchange OR ITS AFFILIATES OR ITS
                OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, OR EMPLOYEES (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO
                YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE PUBLIC NETWORK TERMS,
                YOUR USE OF THE NETWORK OR SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, YOU AND Code Exchange
                SHALL FIRST CONSULT WITH EACH OTHER TO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE SUCH DISPUTE IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO BOTH
                PARTIES, AND THAT IF A RESOLUTION IS NOT REACHED WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS, THEN THE DISPUTE SHALL BE
                REFERRED TO AND RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER JAMS, INC.’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF
                CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
                TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
                RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF
                NEW YORK. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT,
                AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an
                alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small
                claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed
                or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will
                participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to
                arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY
                CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF
                INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private or
                representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to
                the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and
                not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event JAMS, INC. is unwilling or unable to set a
                hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect
                to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the
                award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any
                provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages,
                remedies or awards that conflict with these Public Network Terms. You agree that regardless of any
                statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected
                with the use of the public Network or these Public Network Terms must be filed within one (1) year after
                such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</p>
              <p>You agree that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, any arbitration proceeding between you and
                us will be conducted in New York, NY, USA, that the language of the arbitration shall be in English, and
                that all arbitration proceedings shall be considered confidential in nature.</p>
              <p>If you don’t want to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this section,
                you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first accept these Public
                Network Terms (unless a longer period is required by applicable law), and then you must litigate any
                disputes against us in accordance with the “Assignment and Jurisdiction” section below. Your written
                notification must be mailed to us at Code Exchange, Attn: Legal Department, 110 William Street, Floor
                28, New York, NY 10038 or by email notification at team (at) stackoverflow.com. If you do not notify us
                in accordance with this paragraph, you agree to be bound by the terms of this section, including,
                without limitation, the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and also including such
                provisions in any modifications we make to these Public Network Terms after the date of your first
                acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your name; (ii) your email address and mailing address;
                and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration or waive your
                ability to participate in a class action. If we make any changes to this section (other than a change to
                the address at which we will receive notices or rejections of future changes to this section), you may
                reject any such change by sending us written notice, within thirty (30) days of the change, to the
                address set out in the “Notices” section. It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change
                to this section if you had properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first accepted
                the provisions in this section. If you have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change,
                you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this
                section, as modified by any changes you did not reject. A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph
                solely affects these Public Network Terms; if you previously entered into other arbitration or dispute
                resolution agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that
                you are opting out of the provisions in this section shall not affect the other arbitration agreements
                between you and us.</p>
